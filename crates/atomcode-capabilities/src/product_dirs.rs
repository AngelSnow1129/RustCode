//! Where the product keeps its data — handed in, never looked up.
//!
//! Every capability that persists (skills, plugins, memory, MCP config, sessions,
//! setup state, the credential guard) needs two things: the user-level tree
//! (`~/.atomcode`, or wherever the person moved it) and, per project, the dir
//! under the working directory (`<project>/.atomcode`). This crate used to spell
//! both itself and read `$ATOMCODE_HOME` from the environment wherever it
//! needed one. Two downstreams paid for that:
//!
//! - a fork renaming its tree edited ~240 files, and re-edits them in the merge
//!   commit every time it takes upstream;
//! - a program importing these crates could only relocate them by setting
//!   `ATOMCODE_HOME` before every entry point — and the entry point that forgot
//!   read its login from the wrong tree and told a logged-in person they were not.
//!
//! So the name is the host's: it builds one `ProductDirs` (for this product,
//! `ProductDirs::new(Config::config_dir(), distribution::PROJECT_DIR_NAME)`) and
//! passes it down. Nothing in this crate spells the product directory
//! (`gates/product-dir.sh` holds it to that). Forgetting to pass it is a compile
//! error rather than a silent read from somewhere else.
