//! Modals: the one thing on screen that takes the keyboard.
//!
//! An overlay is a `Region::Stack` child, so it composes like anything else —
//! but focus is **arbitration, not composition**: exactly one may hold it, and
//! the host decides which. That is the honest boundary; a region tree can say
//! two things overlap, it cannot say which one a key belongs to.
//!
//! What is left here are the modals that are a flow rather than a list — the
//! onboarding and pairing wizards (`crate::wizard`). A list to pick from, or a
//! file or a diff to read, is the bottom sheet (`crate::sheet`): it rises from
//! the foot of the screen like every other working panel instead of covering
//! the conversation.
