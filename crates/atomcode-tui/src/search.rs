//! `Ctrl+R`: find something you said before by a word that was in it.
//!
//! Arrowing back through the history answers "what did I just say?". Once the
//! history reaches across sessions ([`crate::host::Host`] folds it from every
//! session log in this project) it holds hundreds of lines, and arrowing is no
//! longer a way through them — a person looking for the one command with
//! `--features session` in it would press Up forty times or give up and retype.
//! Searching is the way through, and `Ctrl+R` is the chord every shell has
//! taught for it.
//!
//! **The composer shows the query; the matches rise above it as a list.** What
//! is typed while a search is up goes to the query, and every entry it matches
//! is listed over the field, newest at the bottom against it — so a person sees
//! how many there are and picks one, instead of stepping through them one at a
//! time blind. The rules:
//!
//! 1. **Opening shows nothing.** An empty query matches no entry and fills
//!    nothing in. It used to show the newest entry at once, shell-style — and
//!    then `Ctrl+R`, Enter, Enter sent the last prompt again, which a person
//!    reaching for search did not mean. "The last thing" is what Up is for;
//! 2. a printable character extends the query, Backspace shortens it, and the
//!    list is matched again with the newest lit;
//! 3. Up — or `Ctrl+R` again, the shell's key for it — lights the next
//!    **older** match; Down the next newer;
//! 4. **Enter only accepts**: the lit entry goes into the composer and the
//!    search closes — a second Enter sends it. One keystroke between "I found
//!    it" and "it is gone to the model" is a keystroke too few;
//! 5. Esc gives back the draft that was set aside;
//! 6. **any other key accepts the lit entry and then does its ordinary job** —
//!    so `Home`, `Ctrl+U`, or typing on after it all keep working without anyone
//!    having to learn a way out.
//!
//! Matching is a case-insensitive substring, newest first, because that is what
//! a person means by "the one with `nextest` in it". The same line said twice is
//! listed once, where it was said last: two rows reading the same are one
//! choice, not two.
