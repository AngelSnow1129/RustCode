//!
//! Separate table from [`crate::product`], same locale. The split is by who
//! says it: a line drawn by `atomcode-tui` is here, a line the CLI or the
//! daemon prints is there. Neither crate can see the other's table, and neither
//! needs to — [`crate::runtime`] holds the one language switch.
//!
//! **What does not belong here.** Fixture text that exists to prove the
//! renderer can draw it (`conformance.rs`'s CJK samples, `--audit`'s demo
//! input) stays a literal: it is the *subject* of the drawing, not a sentence
//! to a person, and translating it would delete the property it was written to
//! check. `gates/tui-i18n.sh` exempts those two files by name for that reason.
