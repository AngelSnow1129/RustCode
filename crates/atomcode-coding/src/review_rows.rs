//! The review specialization as two rows of this product's tree:
//! `tool-code-review` (the `code_review` tool and `/review`) and

//! particular specialization (`atomcode-review`). The harness keeps what is
//! generic about them — `register_review_command` turns any reviewer tool into
//! `/review` — and the rows that know which reviewer this is live here, beside
